Building using cmake:
- create a new build directory
- run cmake .. in this directory 
  (you probably want to define CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX)
- make
- make install

Provided the libraries can be found by your system, you can link
against them by using: 
-lcd -lcd_penetration -lfile_parsing -ls_object s_polyhedron and
-lstp-bv according to your needs
